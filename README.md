# SAGD: A Comprehensive Sex-Associated Gene Database from Transcriptomes

http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/SAGD

Large amount of sex-associated genes (SAG), which have varied expression between females and males, are responsible for the remarkable sex differences in morphological, physiological and behavioral phenotypes of animals. SAGD systematically incorporating all public transcriptomic datasets with paired female and male samples, as well as related publications to analyze SAG. It contains 91,836 SAGs in 21 species by curating data from 2,828 samples of 38 projects.

In SAGD, users can:

Browse or search genes in different species and filter by their sex bias and significance in certain development stage and tissue;

Browse or search drugs and find out the sex bias of their target genes;

Browse or search high-throughput transcriptomic data with high quality paired female and male samples.
